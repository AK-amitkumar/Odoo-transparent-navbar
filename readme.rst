Modal Popup Extention
========================

- this extention provides currently four different modal appearance styles:
	- fade in from behind (#fadIn)
	- fade in from top	(#fadeOn)
	- drop down from top (#sticky)
	- stroke animated fade in (#morphIn)

- to use the animations, install the module and try the different styles by dragging the "modal button snippet" onto your website
- for adaptation change the ID's of the modals so the chosen styles are applied
- to change styling, go into static > src > sass
